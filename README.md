My master's thesis project investigated the influences of biological and psychological risk factors on aggressive behavior 
in men with and without major depressive disorder (MDD). These codes offer insights into the preprocessing and analysis of 
a partial dataset from the MSPP project ("Male-Specific Psychotherapeutic Program") that was used to test my hypotheses. 
In short, the R scripts contain information about:

1. Data preprocessing steps
2. Checking for parametric assumptions
3. Hypothesis testing
4. Generating APA-formatted regression tables and transforming them into Word documents
5. Plotting the results
